  This video is about thrashing and working sets. The explanations are very clear and concise.'
* [Process Scheduling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h3eWaPx8SA){:target="_blank"} ---
  From this video  I learned that multiprogramming and time-sharing are key objectives in process scheduling, allowing multiple processes to execute efficiently and users to interact with programs in real-time. A process scheduler is crucial as it manages which processes get CPU time, optimizing for both performance and user experience. Scheduling queues, like the job queue (holding all processes in the system) and the ready queue (holding processes ready for execution), help prioritize tasks to avoid bottlenecks. Understanding these elements is essential because they enable the operating system to maximize CPU utilization and ensure a responsive, fair user experience, especially in systems handling multiple tasks or users simultaneously.
* [Process Management (Processes and Threads)](	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrM7nZcxXZU){:target="_blank"} ---
  In this video, I learned that processes are the active instances of programs, each with its own memory space, and are crucial for multitasking on an operating system. Threads, on the other hand, are smaller units within processes that share the same memory but execute tasks independently, allowing for more efficient processing within a single application. Understanding the difference between processes and threads is essential because it highlights how operating systems manage resources and execute tasks more efficiently, enhancing performance in both single and multi-user environments. This knowledge is fundamental for optimizing applications and ensuring they can run multiple tasks smoothly and effectively.
* [Memory Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDPYpf-nsDY){:target="_blank"} ---
  In this video, I discovered that it's the process through which an operating system efficiently allocates memory space to applications while keeping track of each active program's memory usage. This involves techniques like paging, segmentation, and virtual memory, which help prevent conflicts and ensure that the system doesnâ€™t run out of memory. Memory management is critical because it optimizes the use of available memory, allowing multiple applications to run simultaneously without crashing or slowing down the system. This is essential for overall system stability and performance, especially in multitasking environments.
* [Explaining File Systems: NTFS, exFAT, FAT32, ext4 & More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws){:target="_blank"} ---
  This video explained that file systems like NTFS, FAT32, exFAT, ext4, and APFS are structures used to organize and manage data on storage drives. Each file system has unique features: NTFS is commonly used on Windows due to its support for large files and advanced security, while FAT32 is simpler and compatible with many devices, although it has limitations on file size. exFAT offers compatibility with both Windows and macOS without those size limits, making it ideal for flash drives. ext4 is popular in Linux systems for its stability and efficiency, while APFS is optimized for Apple devices. Understanding these file systems is essential for choosing the right format based on device compatibility, file size requirements, and performance, especially when working across different platforms.
* [The Critical-Section Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtEORPakw5Y){:target="_blank"} ---
  The video explains the critical-section problem in concurrent programming, where multiple processes access shared resources. It emphasizes the need for synchronization to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency. This understanding is good for building reliable multi-threaded applications.
* [Nonblocking communication](https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-1.1/mpi-11-html/node44.html){:target="_blank"} ---
  The document explains **blocking send and receive** operations in MPI (Message Passing Interface), where processes wait until a message is fully sent or received before continuing. This ensures data is transferred correctly between processes in parallel computing. Understanding these operations is crucial for managing process synchronization and communication effectively in distributed systems.
* [Message Passing Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fViAyFLOYxU){:target="_blank"} ---
  The video explains how processes in an operating system communicate by sending messages, either waiting for confirmation (synchronous) or continuing without it (asynchronous). It covers the basics of blocking and non-blocking communication, as well as different ways messages are stored temporarily, like in fixed or unlimited buffers. This is important because understanding message passing and buffering helps design systems that can handle tasks efficiently and prevent communication issues in multi-process environments.
* [Processes, Threads, Deadlock, Semaphores, and More](https://medium.com/geekculture/processes-threads-deadlock-semaphores-and-more-f70be5395ef6){:target="_blank"} ---
  The article explains the basics of **processes and threads**, which are ways a computer runs multiple tasks, as well as **deadlock**, where tasks get stuck waiting on each other, and **semaphores**, tools that help manage task access to resources. It shows how deadlocks can slow down or freeze a system if not managed properly. Understanding these concepts is important because they help in designing programs that run smoothly without getting stuck or overloading resources.
